console.log("Hello Employers!");

My name is Elliott, I am currently a budding full-stack junior software engineer. I've recently taken the 'jump' into hyperspace by undertaking a brand new career change into the realm of software development.

Prior to this shift. The majority of my previous professional experience has been with the realm of the public sector, specifically local government, as a civil servant in a variety of different positions such as Children's Safeguarding and Adult Social services. Although I  take great pride in the knowledge my work has positively impacted many peoples lives, I believe software development may actually give me the tools to impact and help a wider community.
I love the idea of seeing purposeful work, envisaged at a rudimentary stage come to fruition. I'd consider myself inquisitive, curious and a methodical thinker. I like to understand the root of a problem before attempting to tackle it head on. I hope to create purposeful software that can be wide-reaching, potentially used in government, charities or social enterprises to better help improve peoples lives.

I have chosen to take my professional career to the next step and in December 2021, began studying at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a sixteen-week intensive boot camp in-which i learnt the fundamentals software development. During my studies there, I learnt how to apply 'Agile working' methodology in a software development project setting.
I had learnt how to adapt both self-learning and pair programme to enhance my learning. Through the facilitation of Makers, I was also able to complete several process reviews. As part of our course, we completed a total of 3x team projects and a solo weekly weekend project - 10x in total. (For example <a href="https://blooming-bastion-46086.herokuapp.com/">A Facebook clone - a team project created in two weeks</a>).
As part of good learning, we were encouraged to complete regular constructive code reviews of our peers work. Emotional intelligence; an understanding of the needs of a team and how to support them was also a core aspect of the Makers ethos. An ethos, that I hope to carry with me like a badge of honour for all those future life/career adventures that are just on the horizon.

## Skills
### Time Management
During my last role in Adult Social services as a (CCW) Community care worker. I had to organise my own case load of patients which would need to be assessed within set statutory timeframes. I would manage my time as efficiently as possible whilst also remaining empathetic, understanding and flexibility due to the unpredictability and unique circumstances of clients lives. If care was not applied in a timely manner, the safety of vulnerable people would be jeopardised.
When studying at Makers, the same skill sets often applied. During our 3x team projects it was important to ensure an MVP was agreed upon by the team and met within submission deadlines. Keen organisation and open honest communication was important for the whole team to meet our client (Makers Academy)'s objective.

### Empathetic/Reflective
Whilst working in the Public Sector. I would work with a large demographic base of residents. Some with different languages, ages or specific support needs/disabilities and circumstances. Providing, relevant up-to date information whilst also being service user centric, compassionate and patient of that persons needs / challenges.
Whilst completing the Makers Course, an emphasis on team work and pair programming was instilled from our first day. As such I felt it was important to have good communication with my peers, to understand any needs or challenges they might have early on.

I'd always be willing to lend a hand to anyone that asks. This included both professionally and personally. I enjoy communicating with others with an aim to build meaningful relationships. I am open and honest. I value honesty and constructive criticism above most things as long as it is not to the detriment of others. I regularly take time to reflect and try to improve myself wherever possible through peer discussions, reviews, therapy and meditation.

### Leadership and Team work
During team projects, I excelled during the planning stages. I have strong written and verbal skills. I thoroughly enjoyed organising the teams schedule for the day. This involved setting up daily project retros and kick offs, minute taking information from meetings on Figma. Writing up blogs and assigning / progressing user stories on the team Trello board. I believe a lot of this stems from my previous work experience. Often in Social services, I would be responsible for working together with multi-agency disciplines to create personal, holistic reports for my clients, usually under string time constraints.
Another recent example of showing leadership was during the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020. I was part of an emergency (Shielding team) brought together in-light of the Covid-19 pandemic which was in collaboration with the NHS. The team was made up of civil servants across the council most of which had never met one another. It was my responsibility to manage this team, encase of any social care or legal matters, for a number of weeks with the ultimate aim of providing urgent care packages to those most vulnerable / unable to leave their homes.

### Quick Learner
I consider myself to be a quick learner, I felt very proud after learning 3 languages over a 12 week period at Makers (Ruby, JavaScript & Python).
